==============

hands-on for NGS/SNParray CNV call trainning

# Introduction
This workshop will show you how to proceed when to detect Copy Number Variants (CNV) using either Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or SNParray data 

The initial structure of your folders should look like this:
```
/lb/project/mugqic/hgen698_X
|-- reference/               # genome and annotation files
|-- raw_reads/               # fastqs from the center (down sampled)
    `-- SAMPLE               # One sample directory
        `-- runXXXX_Y        # Lane directory by run number. Contains the fastqs

```





## Aknowledgments
The format for this tutorial has been inspired from Mar Gonzalez Porta of Embl-EBI and Louis letourneau from MUGQIC, who I would like to thank and acknowledge.
